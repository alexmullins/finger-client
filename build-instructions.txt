These projects are built with the Rust programming language (https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).
Think C/C++ but no segmentation faults or memory errors. Yay!

A prebuilt binary is located in the root directory: finger-client
===========================
Section 1. Installing Rust
===========================
To compile successfully, you need internet access.

Easiest way is to compile on a linux VM with internet access and copy the binarys to the 
isolated VMs using Virtual Box sharing or USB. 

You need to install the Rust nightly compiler to compile the echo and finger clients.

The easiest way to get the compiler is to download the installer from the site:

https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

Extract the .tar.gz and run the install.sh that is in the extracted folder with sudo:

sudo ./install.sh

To check if it correctly installed everything run:

rustc --version

===============================================
Section 2. Compiling and running finger-client
===============================================
In a terminal, cd to the "finger-client" folder that was downloaded.
In this folder should be the Cargo.toml file and src folder. From
here run:

cargo build --release

This command will download all of the projects dependencies and build 
them and then build our finger-client binary. The finger-client binary
will be located in the ./target/release/ folder and can be run like:

./finger-client
./finger-client user
./finger-client user@host
